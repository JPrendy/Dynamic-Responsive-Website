<p>The Young Leaders Committee was setup in August of 2018 to assist the mainstream and justice team in organising and planning for events. Their most recent accomplishment involved assisting the project and taking on essential roles for our community day &
website launch. Their ongoing commitment and support to the project is awe-inspiring. Meeting up once a week to discuss in a professional format, the Young Leaders Committee strive each and every week to ensure the young people of  are getting
the best experience possible from each and every event they organise. Currently the committee consists of five members, but are open to more young people entering into the group to give fresh ideas and a different outlook.</p>
